# ContactForm

Feel free to build this and run it as a standalone app or use the template as a practice tool for different kinds of SQL operations.

One thing I like to do is try and force chances in the server side to see how will the app react to them (will it trow an exception) and why.

It may be simple, but it has a lot of potential for tinkering.

Thank you, Viyaj!
